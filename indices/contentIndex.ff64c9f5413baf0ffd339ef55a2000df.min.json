I wonder if watching pipeline planes fly low and slow over our property got me started. Then it was model airplanes, and model rockets, and rocketry summer camp, and airplane summer camp, then a flying simulator in college, and here I am living that dream having earned my PPL.  There's really no comparison to flying low in a single engine plane...\n\n\u003eDo the impossible, because almost everyone has told me my ideas are merely fantasies. ~ Howard Hughes.\n\n\u003eThe love of flying was the love of beauty. It was more beautiful up there than anything I had known. ~ Amelia Earhart\n\n\u003eEveryone has oceans to fly, if they have the heart to do it. Is it reckless? Maybe. But what do dreams know of boundaries? ~ Amelia Earhart\n\n\u003eThe desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their grueling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through. ~ Orville Wright\n\n\u003eIt has been my observation that the happiest of people, the vibrant doers of the world, are almost always those who are using - who are putting into play, calling upon, depending upon-the greatest number of their God-given talents and capabilities. ~John Glenn\n## Current Status\nPPL\n\n## Goals\n1.
