There's really no comparison to flying low in a single engine plane...\n\n\u003eDo the impossible, because almost everyone has told me my ideas are merely fantasies. ~ Howard Hughes.\n\n\u003eThe love of flying was the love of beauty.

But what do dreams know of boundaries? ~ Amelia Earhart\n\n\u003eThe desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their grueling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through. ~ Orville Wright\n\n\u003eIt has been my observation that the happiest of people, the vibrant doers of the world, are almost always those who are using - who are putting into play, calling upon, depending upon-the greatest number of their God-given talents and capabilities. ~John Glenn\n# Current Status\nPPL\n\n# Goals\n1.

Add the more recent innovations of intermittent wind and solar power — and customers generating their own electricity and sharing it back into the network — and the challenge becomes clearer.\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-launches-25-billion-fund-modernize-and-expand-capacity-americas-power\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-expansion-modernization-of-the-electric-grid/ \n\n\nhttps://www.electricaltechnology.org/2013/07/active-reactive-apparent-and-complex.html\n\nhttp://energy.gov/oe/smart-grid-primer-smart-grid-books\n\n\n+ https://ses.jrc.ec.europa.eu/smart-grid-interactive-tool-non-flash","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T23:33:39.121063068Z","tags":null},"/notes/electrical-concepts/smart-grids/Smart-Grid-Power-Electronics":{"title":"Smart Grid Concepts","content":"\nhttps://www.digikey.com/en/articles/power-modules-underpin-smart-grid-adoption\n\n\nPhasor Measurement Units (PMUs) that allow operators to assess grid stability, advanced digital meters that give consumers better information and automatically report outages, relays that sense and recover from faults in substations automatically, automated feeder switches that re-route power around problems, and batteries that store excess energy and make it available to the grid later to meet customer demand.\n\nWhen an underground fault or single loss of source occurs on an underground residential loop, the EdgeRestore system automatically locates and isolates the fault and reroutes power from an alternate source—all within 60 seconds.\n\nMehdi Hosseini, a data scientist with Beyond Limits, explained that AI can help the performance of the smart grid in two major ways. “One of them is accurate prediction of demand and generation, and the other is the real-time grid operation,” he said.\n\n“Power utility companies rely heavily on long-term and short-term predictions,” Hosseini explained. “For example, every day they require an accurate prediction of the electrical demand of the next day. The electrical demand is heavily associated with weather data, business activities, and everything that affect those business activities. So, they go through historical data to find patterns and point associations between those two to have an accurate prediction.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T23:33:39.121063068Z","tags":null},"/notes/labview/LabVIEW":{"title":"LabVIEW","content":"My favorite programming language\n# Good links\nBest resources\n- [LabVIEW Wiki](https://labviewwiki.org/wiki/Home)\n- [LAVA](https://lavag.org/)\n\n# Interesting Projects\nSome interesting projects I've encountered\n- [RTL-SDR](notes/RTLSDR/LabVIEW-RTL-SDR-Resources.md)\n- [OpenBCI](notes/openBCI/OpenBCI.md)\n\n# Training\nNotes and concepts\n[[notes/labview/RT/RT Notes]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T23:33:39.197064315Z","tags":null},"/notes/labview/RT/RT-Notes":{"title":"RT Notes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T23:33:39.197064315Z","tags":null},"/notes/labview/linx/Raspberry-Pi-Setup":{"title":"Raspberry Pi Setup","content":"# Required Tools\n1.
