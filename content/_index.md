Welcome to [my](notes/me/Laura.md) digital garden! Feel free to explore links and wander down any path you like. 

Here you will find some of my current [projects](notes/myprojects/Projects.md) and my latest [interests](notes/me/Journey%20of%20Discovery.md). But you may also stumble upon a list of my favorite [Trips](notes/myadventures/travel/Trips.md) or my latest [aviation obsession](notes/aviation/Aviation-Topics.md). Even more, if you come back next week, you may find that the [garden](notes/me/why-garden.md) has suddenly grown in a completely different direction. The best [gardens](notes/nature/plants/Native%20Plants.md) are partially wild, anyhow 🍀
