## Background
Wouldn't it be fun to make my own [QuantumComputing](notes/electrical/quantum/QuantumComputing.md) random number generator?

## Possible Solutions

- Use a radioactive source, a splitter, and two [GeigerCounters](notes/myprojects/environmental/GeigerCounter.md)
- Use a laser source, a 50/50 beam splitter, and photoresistors
