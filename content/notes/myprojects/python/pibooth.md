## Summary
The [pibooth](pibooth.org) project has been a great resource to building an easy raspberry pi photobooth. We've had so much fun with it and it has made an appearance at two parties so far. 

### Features
- take photos, save and sync photos, and print photos at will
- Easy to use
- cheap (most expensive component = raspberry pi)
- written in python and open source
- Nice plugin architecture
	- ability to automatically send to a google photos album
	- ability to modify picture layout with a draw.io template

## Final Results
Success!!

### Version 1- Oct '22
Halloween themed - Worked great but I wasn't happy about how many cables I had laying around...

### Version 2 - March '23
Baby shower themed - was a hit! I notice that it is difficult to look at the camera up above when the screen is a foot below it. We get a few pictures where everyone is looking at the screen instead of the camera. Stay tuned for improvements for version 3...
