# Background

An index of projects in the pipeline, and showcase of completed ones

## Seedlings
- [Weather Station](notes/myprojects/environmental/WeatherStation.md)
- LabVIEW + OpenBCI
	- First, use the PCB files and have an OpenBCI headset made. 
	- Then, create a [LabVIEW](notes/software/labview/LabVIEW.md) GUI for [OpenBCI](notes/electrical/biomedical/openBCI/OpenBCI.md)
- hydroponic indoor garden
- [GeigerCounter](notes/myprojects/environmental/GeigerCounter.md)
- [QRNG](notes/myprojects/electrical/QRNG.md)
- microcontroller quadcopter
	- use an arduino or raspberry pi, or raspberry pi pico
- create a [Native Butterfly Garden](notes/nature/plants/Native%20Butterfly%20Garden.md)

## Potted Plants
- Creating a Li-ION [battery pack](notes/myprojects/electrical/BatteryPacks.md)
- A [LabVIEW](notes/software/labview/LabVIEW.md) [RTLSDR](notes/electrical/RF/RTLSDR/RTL-SDR.md) ADS-B GUI
	- https://github.com/laurammiller/ADS-B

## Mature
- Learning Blender basics to make [LabVIEW Earrings](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6067515)
- [pibooth photobooth](notes/myprojects/python/pibooth.md)
- [Flapping costume fairy wings](https://youtu.be/5IRo4BEg1Yw)
- The evolution of the Xmas Sweater
	- Year 1: A single LED
	- Year 2: A string of flashing LEDs
	- Year 3: GPS/Accelerometer Neopixels , Santa on a Motorcycle
	- Year 4: [Heartbeat controlled LEDs on a Christmas Cat](https://youtu.be/hRNXAWwt218)
	- Year 5: Cell phone motors ringing jingle bells on a gingerbread man
	- Year 6: An actual cell phone sweater
		- sweater responded to commands by text and could recieve calls
		- Recieved a spam call while wearing sweater and could not hang up, that was fun
	- Year 7: [Wifi and MQTT Particle Boron Pillow project](https://youtu.be/myvxh5iQPjU)[Video2](https://youtu.be/1e68_r3FYWs)
	- Year 8: Cell phone controlled color changing and color matching 
	- Year 9: Raspberry Pi Pico controlling Neopixels through a self-hosted web interface
