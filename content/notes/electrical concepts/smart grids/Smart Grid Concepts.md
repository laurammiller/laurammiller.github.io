# Summary 
A smart grid is an electricity network that uses digital and other advanced technologies to monitor and manage the transport of electricity from all generation sources to meet the varying electricity demands of end users.

Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) that allow operators to assess grid stability, advanced digital meters that give consumers better information and automatically report outages, relays that sense and recover from faults in substations automatically, automated feeder switches that re-route power around problems, and batteries that store excess energy and make it available to the grid later to meet customer demand.

When an underground fault or single loss of source occurs on an underground residential loop, the EdgeRestore system automatically locates and isolates the fault and reroutes power from an alternate source—all within 60 seconds.

Mehdi Hosseini, a data scientist with Beyond Limits, explained that AI can help the performance of the smart grid in two major ways. “One of them is accurate prediction of demand and generation, and the other is the real-time grid operation,” he said.

“Power utility companies rely heavily on long-term and short-term predictions,” Hosseini explained. “For example, every day they require an accurate prediction of the electrical demand of the next day. The electrical demand is heavily associated with weather data, business activities, and everything that affect those business activities. So, they go through historical data to find patterns and point associations between those two to have an accurate prediction.

The first power grids built in the late 19th century were simple affairs: Electricity was generated at a central power station and delivered nearby to customers.

That system grew more complex with long-distance transmission between states and regions. Add the more recent innovations of intermittent wind and solar power — and customers generating their own electricity and sharing it back into the network — and the challenge becomes clearer.

high voltage DC transmission lines

For DC, “you charge the electrical capacitance of the cable when you energize it, but then the voltage stays constant, so there is no routine charging and recharging of the cables,” Rosenqvist said. “Once a DC cable has been energized, you have the capacity of the electrical conductor in the cable available for transmitting real power, and there is really no practical length limitation on how far you can go with a DC cable.” DC cables can enable transmissions of up to 2,000 MW at very high voltages in a single circuit, “which is not possible using AC technology,” Rosenqvist said.

MMC technology was commercially deployed for the first time worldwide in 2018 as an upgraded control system in an HVDC system in the Trans Bay Cable (TBC) project (Figure 3), which includes a 53-mile HVDC submarine cable that runs under San Francisco Bay.
