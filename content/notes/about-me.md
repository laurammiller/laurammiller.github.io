Hello! I'm Laura. 

![Me](avatar.png "Me")
This is my personal wiki, in the style of a dynamic digital [garden](why-garden) ðŸª´ using Quartz ~~Jekyll~~ and Obsidian. I'm an two time electrical engineer (BSEE and MSEE) and a LabVIEW developer. I'm forever tinkering with microcontrollers, wearables, home automation, photography, gardening, and anything related to aviation.
