An index of topics correlated with airplanes, my love of aviation, and some related tech that I find interesting.
# General Aviation
- [My Flying Career](notes/aviation/My%20Flying%20Career.md)

# Technologies and Concepts
## ADS-B
The newly required communication method (in most busy airspaces in the US) between aircrafts and towers to exchange information about position, altitude, speed, heading, type, etc.

- [ADS-B](notes/aviation/ADSB/ADS-B.md)

## Propulsion
How to overcome the forces of gravity. Combustion engines rule in general aviation and have for 100 years, but I hope to see some really cool things coming soon.
- s[Propulsion](notes/aviation/propulsion/Propulsion%20Topics.md)

## Fringe/Rabbit hole
- [Searl Effect Generator](https://segmagnetics.com/)

## Weather
Pilots are part-time meteorologists by nature. Maybe I should build my own [weather station](notes/myprojects/environmental/WeatherStation.md)?
