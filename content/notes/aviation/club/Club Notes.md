Annuals
- 2022 $9357
	-  All ADs have been complied with including the eddy current  inspection on the spars, which was done last year. The cost to perform the annual  inspection was $9,357.98. Dave (the A&P mechanic) spent 112 hours on it but only  charged us for 91 hours (@$80/hr). John spent another 40 to 50 hours of his time  working on the seats at no cost to the club. Major items addressed this year include:  
		- Wing spar inspection panels installed.  
		- Left magneto, 500-hour inspection and repaired (broken parts were passed  around at the meeting).  
		- Elevator trim drum, shaft, bearings and the cable were replaced.  
		- Front seats were disassembled and repaired. We had to do some welding of the  steel frame along with some aluminum supports in the seat-backs. The frames  were fabricated and riveted in place and then the seats were re-covered with  our new foam and fabric. All the labor for this was completed by John at no cost  to the club.  
		- Engine fuel sump drain was replaced as the old one was leaking badly.
