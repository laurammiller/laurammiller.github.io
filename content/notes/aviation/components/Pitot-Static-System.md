Ambient air pressure for the pitot and static pressure are supplied through the pitot head on the bottom of the left wing of the Piper Archer. This is part of the complete airspeed, [altimeter](notes/aviation/components/altimeter.md) and VSI system.

An alternate static source is available using the control valve located below the left side of the instrument panel. In the alt position, cabin air is used for static pressure.
