## Description 
Ambient air enters the device into the back panel from the outside static port. Inside the altimeter is a bellows (aneroid) which expands or contracts based on the air pressure inside. This mechanically rotates the front panel arms through a series of gears.  The instrument is "calibrated" by setting the barometric pressure to the most recently available measurement at current altitude.
