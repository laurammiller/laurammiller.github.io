# Background
It has been on my mind lately to create a little walking path/garden with native plants for pollinators. I'd love to attract butterflies, hummingbirds, and bees!  I recently learned that once butterflies "learn" of a good patch of milkweed or other good plants, they come back year after year to the same spot.
