- radiation thermometer
- non-contact thermometer

Measures radiation from an object at a distance in order to determine the object's temperature. The radiation (IR-infared) is in the electromagnetic spectrum

## Types

### optical
measure temperature by comparing the object visually with a calibrated filament that can be adjusted by temperature

### radiation
focused radiation (using lenses/mirrors) is directed at a [Thermocouple](notes/electrical/sensors/Thermocouple.md) or an array of thermocouples
