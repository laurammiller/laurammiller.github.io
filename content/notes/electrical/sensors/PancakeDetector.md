## Background
Variation of a [GeigerMullerTube](notes/electrical/sensors/GeigerMullerTube.md). May be referred to as a G-M counter. Measures approx 2 in across and 1/2 inch thick.  The face of the detector is a mica "window." Particles pass through and interact with the gas inside, allowing electrons to move from the chassis (cathode) to the internally suspended high voltage anode.
