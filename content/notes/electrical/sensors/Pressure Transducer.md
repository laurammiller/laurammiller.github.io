## Background
Measures pressure. Some common designs use a flexible diaphram, strain gauge, capacitance, or piezoelectric sensors to convert a pressure into an electrical signal.  Similar concepts in the [[notes/aviation/components/Altimeter|Altimeter]] which converts ambient air pressure to mechanical movement, which translates to a dial location on the panel of a cockpit.

### Strain Gauge
A fluid exerts pressure on the strain gage, which becomes deformed, which results in a voltage variation which corresponds to the magnitude of the pressure.

### Piezoelectric
A non-static (dynamic) pressure transducer. One type uses strain gauges bonded to a diaphragm so that deformations in the diaphragm result in differences in resistance in the strain gauge. These are typically arranged in a [[notes/electrical/concepts/Circuits|Wheatstone Bridge]]configuration which translates this to a voltage reading.
