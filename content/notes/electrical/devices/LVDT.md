Linear Variable Differential Transformer , also known as Linear Variable Displacement Transducer , and also differential transformer.

## Description 
A transformer that measures linear position. Another variation of this design is RVDT which measures rotary movement.

A transformer (consisting of alternating primary and secondary coils) is wrapped around a ferromagnetic rod.  A current is driven through the primary coils, which induces a current in the secondary circuit.  As the ferromagnetic core's position changes, the induced voltage in the secondary circuit changes.
