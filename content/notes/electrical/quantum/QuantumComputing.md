## Background
A photon is considered both a wave and a particle. When a photon is observed it behaves like a particle. When not observed, it behaves like a wave.  Quantum computers use these principles along with the principle of entanglement.

## A simple implementation

Using a polorizing beam splitter, create two paths/modes based upon the polorization of a photon. If a photon is not perfectly horizontal or vertical, it will be both reflected and passed through the polarizer. Upon detection/measurement by one of the two photoresistors, the entangled photon collapses randomly back into the particle state and is measured.
