## Description

Thin slices of silicon used in the production of integrated circuits or for solar cells. The wafer serves as a substrate for microelectronic devices built in and on the wafer. Silicon by itself is not very conductive, but a process called "doping" is used to precisely inject impurites which control the resistivity of the silicon.  Doping is one of many fabrication processes involved in the development of a packaged silicon wafer [[notes/electrical/concepts/Electrical Concepts|IC]].
