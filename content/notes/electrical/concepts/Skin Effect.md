## Description

AC Current tends to travel on the outer surface of a conductor. This effect increases with the AC frequency (the skin depth decreases as frequency increases.)

This results in an effective increased resistance for AC current in a conductor versus DC current in the same conductor.

## Applications
Due to the skin effect, some [[notes/electrical/RF/RF|RF]] designs such as antennas and power conductors use hollow metal rods rather than solid conductors.
