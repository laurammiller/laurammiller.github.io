A dictionary of acronyms to know/understand in the EE world, as I think of them

ADC - analog to digital converter aka digitizer. For example, these exist on analog input cards and convert an input voltage into a digital value.

Nyquist frequency- in laymen's terms, this is the minimum frequency required to properly sample a periodic signal without distortion(aliasing).  The Nyquist rate should be equal to 2x the highest frequency (aka bandwith) of a signal

IC - Integrated Circuit - an assembly of electronic components with miniature devices built up on a semiconductor substrate
