Hello! I'm Laura. 

This is my personal wiki, in the style of a dynamic digital [garden](why-garden.md) ðŸª´ using Quartz and Obsidian. I'm an two time electrical engineer (BSEE and MSEE) and a [LabVIEW](/content/notes/LabVIEW/LabVIEW.md) developer. I'm forever tinkering with microcontrollers, wearables, home automation, photography, gardening, and anything related to [[content/notes/RTL-SDR/ADS-B-Resources]]
