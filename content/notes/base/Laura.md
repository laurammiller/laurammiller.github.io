Hello! I'm Laura. 

This is my personal wiki, in the style of a dynamic digital [garden](why-garden.md) ðŸª´ using Quartz ~~Jekyll~~ and Obsidian. I'm an two time electrical engineer (BSEE and MSEE) and a [LabVIEW](../LabVIEW.md) developer. I'm forever tinkering with microcontrollers, wearables, home automation, photography, gardening, and anything related to [aviation](../ADS-B Basics.md).
