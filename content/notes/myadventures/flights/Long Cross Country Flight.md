## Route 

The route was Allegheny County Airport (KAGC) to Pittsburgh Butler Regional (KBTP) to Erie International (KERI) to Allegheny County (KAGC). As a requirement for obtaining a PPL, a student must plan and solo fly a three-part trip where the total distance is 150nm and at least one leg is longer than 50nm. The weather was beautiful with a few fluffy clouds above me. It was surreal to start to see the lake on the horizon as I approached the airport. Radar service had lost me somewhere over Mercer county in northwestern PA which was interesting. Landing at KERI was intense for me as a student pilot- the controller was in a bit of a hurry so she had be do a 180 right in the middle of the runway to taxi back and take off again quickly. She wanted me out of the way of the big jets! (and their revenue)
