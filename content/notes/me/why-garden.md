[I](notes/me/Laura.md) love gardening, and I love electrons. Here you will find a combination of both.

This is my space to put ideas out "into the void" and capture the links between subjects and ideas as they evolve.  I have the freedom in this format to prune and nurture these thoughts over time as I learn and explore. Some call it a digital garden, some call it a [second brain](https://github.com/sspaeti/Second-Brain) and it is closely related to the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) note-taking philosophy in which the links between ideas and notes are a critical part of the process. 

I was inspired by [Digital Gardens](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/ "Digital Gardens") and my wiki is built upon the excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).
