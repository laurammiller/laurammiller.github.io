Hello! I'm Laura. 

This is my personal wiki, in the style of a dynamic digital [garden](notes/basic/why-garden.md) 🐛 using Quartz and Obsidian. I'm an two time electrical engineer (BSEE and MSEE) and a [LabVIEW](notes/labview/LabVIEW.md) developer. I'm forever tinkering with microcontrollers, wearables, home automation, photography📷, gardening🌺, and anything related to [aviation]✈️(notes/aviation/Aviation-Topics.md)
