# Terms

### Development

- Lint/Linting - a static code analysis tool used to find programming or syntax errors, bugs, suspicious code.  For example, if coding in Python in Visual Studio Code, you can download a python lint extension that finds bugs as you develop.
- CI - Continuous Integration. A software development methodology where code changes are merged often so that checks and tests can be automatically performed
- CD - Continuous Deployment. A software development strategy where all/most code changes are automatically built into usable applications that can be easily delivered and used
- DevOps- See CI/CD
- Deploy - "launching" or pushing code to a server, or embedded hardware where it will begin to run
- Compiling/[[notes/software/labview/compiler|compiler]] - converting the software written by a human into something that can be understood by a machine
- premature optimization - too much upfront time spent optimizing code when it really doesn't provide much benefit at that point
