# Why Crypto
Traditional banking - the bank is only required to have a certain percentage of your $, and this is how some banks fail when more money is required than they have. (Fractional Reserve). The whole system functions on trust.
Crypto - There is no fractional reserve. When crypto is bought and sold it is based on the liquidity and what is available, and the cost based on supply/demand.
