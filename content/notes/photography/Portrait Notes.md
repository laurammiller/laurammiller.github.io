Some notes about taking photos for a portrait session
## Portrait Basics
 ### Poses
 - Looking up at the photographer is more flattering in general
 - Looking towards light helps brighten eyes if that is important
 - have a list of poses ready before the session but be ready to improvise

### Light
- golden hour (the hour before sunset)
- direction and amount of light can change the tone
	- light in front of subject unless you want a silhouette

### Backdrops
- background can be distracting, use plain backdrops if not using a picturesque location indoors

## Kids
### Camera Settings
- More like sports photography than still. Easy to catch a bunch of blurry photos with the wrong settings
- Example settings
	- Fast shutter speed >1/250
	- Higher ISO (400+, probably 800)
- Wide angle with low light (catch them running)

### Props
- Bubbles
- Noise makers
- Puppet
- Balloons
- Toys (can be tricky - kid ends up more interested in toy)
- Something for them to ride in or sit in. Wagon, bucket, basket.

### Tricks
- pick a time of day when the kids are in a good mood 
	- not hungry 
	- not tired before nap-time
- keep the session very active
- move between a few poses or scenes as quickly as possible
- try many angles
	- shoot at toddler eye level for interesting stuff
- keep them happy
	- make a game out of it
	- if there is a pose or activity that keeps making them smile, go with it
- be very flexible
- don't get stressed out - they will often feed off of your energy or the parents' energy, keep it light and happy
- If indoors, have lights or be by a window to increase light (and available shutter speed)


## Things I'm working on
- keeping sessions short
- reduce # of junk images
