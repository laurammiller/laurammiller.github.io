## The Heart and the Sky
I feel a camaraderie with anyone who has flown and I know it is a common feeling in the flying community.  I spend a lot of time daydreaming about being back up there. Why does it seem to "hook" certain people?

## Auguries of Innocence
I have to admit I first heard this line in the movie Tomb Raider as they decide that it is not a good idea to go back in time and change the way things happened, and there is beauty in life just as it is. Makes me want to go read some Virginia Woolf. How important the little things are.

How often in my life has another person been there when I needed some help! Is it God in us?
