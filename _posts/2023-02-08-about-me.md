Hello! I'm Laura. 

![Me](/assets/img/avatar.png "Me")

This is my personal wiki, in the style of a dynamic digital garden using Jekyll and Obsidian. I'm an two time electrical engineer (BSEE and MSEE) and a LabVIEW developer. I'm forever tinkering with microcontrollers, wearables, home automation, photography, gardening, and anything related to aviation.
