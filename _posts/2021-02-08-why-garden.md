I love gardening, and I love electrons. Here you will find a combination of both.

This is my space to put ideas out "into the void" while also allowing those ideas to grow.  I have the freedom and ability in this format to prune and nurture these public thoughts over time as I learn and explore.  

I was inspired by [Digital Gardens](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/ "Digital Gardens") and my wiki is built upon the excellent [Jekyll Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/).
