I love gardening, and I love electrons. Here you will find a combination of both.

This is my space to put ideas out "into the void" while also allowing those ideas to grow, and to be pruned and nurtured over time.  

I was inspired by (https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/ "Digital Gardens") and this site was built upon the excellent Jekyll Garden (https://jekyll-garden.github.io/).
